Recipe type: main, tofu
Cuisine: easy, vegetarian, healthy
Serves: 2

Ingredients
2 tbsp grapeseed oil (or other neutral oil)
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 block -14oz (396g) House Foods medium firm tofu
2 tbsp Sriracha sauce
1 tbsp soy sauce
1Â½ tbsp honey
1 tbsp rice vinegar
potato starch OR corn starch for dusting (about 2 tbsp)
1 tsp sesame oil
1 tbsp sesame seeds
1 scallion, finely chopped (optional)

Instructions
Whisk sriracha, soy sauce, honey and rice vinegar in a bowl and set aside.
Drain tofu and wrap in paper towel or tea towel to remove excess water. Repeat 3 to 4 times until the tofu is drier. Slice tofu into 1 inch cubes.
Dust tofu with potato starch until all sides are coated.
Use a medium large pan and turn the heat to high. Add oil and when the oil is hot, almost smoking, add garlic and fry for 30 seconds. The oil needs to be very hot in order for the starch to stick to the tofu - be careful of oil spits! Add tofu and fry until the sides are slightly golden (about 7 minutes).
Add sauce and stir while coating tofu cubes. Cook for 3 minutes.
Turn the heat off and add sesame oil and sesame seeds. Stir once more to evenly coat tofu cubes and serve topped with scallions.
